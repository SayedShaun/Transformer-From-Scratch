# Transformer Neural Network Implementation

This repository contains the implementation of a Transformer neural network architecture, primarily focused on natural language processing tasks.

## Files Included:

- **Sample Data**: Placeholder for any sample data used for training or testing purposes.
- **dataloader.py**: Script for loading and preprocessing data for training the model.
- **decoder_model.py**: Implementation of the decoder component of the Transformer model.
- **embedding.py**: Script for creating and managing embeddings within the model.
- **encoder_decoder_model.py**: Implementation of the full Transformer encoder-decoder architecture.
- **encoder_model.py**: Implementation of the encoder component of the Transformer model.
- **train.py**: Script for training the Transformer model using the provided data.
- **transformer_numpy.py**: Implementation of key components of the Transformer model using NumPy.

## Requirements:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
